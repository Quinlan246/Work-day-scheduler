# <Work-day-scheduler>

## The purpose of this weeks homework was to build a scheulde between 9 and 5 that can be edited in the webpage

- It required that anything typed in the text boxes be saved to the local storage so they could render each time the webpage was loaded.

- It needed to have different colors for the past and future depending on the time. Grey was used for the past, red was used for the current hour, and green was used for the future hours.

- Current date and time is displayed at the top of the page.
